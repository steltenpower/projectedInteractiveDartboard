# projectedInteractiveDartboard

Piece of board, webcam, beamer, SVG dartboard with greyvalues for score and SVG GaussFilter to show statistics; cross-correlation (throw it on HTMLcanvas to read out the values of the shades of grey)

(just cause I once wanted to prove a few people that they shouldn't be aiming at triple 20)
